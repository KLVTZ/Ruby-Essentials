Documentation
=============
You have a few options for documentation:

- [Ruby Docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)
- [Ruby Core Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/)
- [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io/ruby/)
- Inside Terminal: `ri <object>#<method>`

The last example can be used when you need a quick explanation on what each
object or method does in ruby. Keep in mind that a command we will be using
often is `Object#inspect`. This will allow us to inspect an object in a human
readable format. We will see the human-readable interpretation to an object.
Handling complex data structures may prove to be a bit more work, but overall,
it does a great job in showing an end result.
