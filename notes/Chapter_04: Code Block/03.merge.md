We create two hashes, both contain a same-name key with different value. We go
ahead and merge both ways. If we merge the hash one with hash two, then the new
key property (or the hash value within the parameter argument) of hash two will
take precedence over the old conflicting key value. The same applies if we
switch the merge to hash one merge with another hash.

This is where block scope can come in handy. We have access to three variable
block parameters. This range variable scopes only applies to the conflicting
key. Ruby can handle all the other merges that do not conflict. We have access
to the following:

- **Key**: current name of key-conflict, not value.
- **Old Value**: belongs to the hash that calls merge (e.g. `hashOne.merge`)
- **New Value**: belongs to the parameter argument within the merge call

In our latest attempt we check to see if the old value is less than the new
value. If not, return the new value as being less. We can change this to a
single ternary as well. Note that if you want to change the hash that calls the
method, use bang!

```bash
[1] pry(main)> h1 = {"a" => 111, "b" => 222}
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222}
[2] pry(main)> h2 = {"b" => 333, "c" => 444}
=> {"b"=>333, "c"=>444}
[3] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2)
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
[4] pry(main)> h2.merge(h1)
=> {"b"=>222, "c"=>444, "a"=>111}
[5] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| new }
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
[6] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| old }
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}
[7] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2) {|key, old, new| old * 2 }
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>444, "c"=>444}
[8] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2) do |key, old, new|
[8] pry(main)*   if old < new
[8] pry(main)*     old
[8] pry(main)*   else
[8] pry(main)*     new
[8] pry(main)*   end
[8] pry(main)* end
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}
[9] pry(main)> h1.merge(h2) {|k, o, n| o < n ? o : n}
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}
[10] pry(main)> h1.merge!(h2)
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
[11] pry(main)> h1
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
```
