Collect
=======

[<< Merge](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_04:%20Code%20Block/03.merge.md)

Collect or map are completely synonomous or using with arrays, hashes, and
ranges. They allow you to use scope in order to process each increment within a
data set -both allow the handling of each value. But remember, for every value
processed, an equal amount must be returned --that can include `nil`. Both
collection and mapping will be primarily used with arrays.

In our first example, within each increment, we process the value and return
back a result. We can multiply the value or even alter a strings precence.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> array = [2,3,4,5,6]
=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[2] pry(main)> array.collect{|i| i * 40}
=> [80, 120, 160, 200, 240]
[3] pry(main)> ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'].map {|fruit| fruit.capitalize}
=> ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]
```

Notice, however, that as soon as we start adding conditions, values that do not
match will not be returned.

Every value process will return --if it doesn't meet the current condition-- a
nil. That is why we can include an else that will default to a value.

Arrays are not the only data set we can use. We can process a range of numbers.
But notice that collect or map will return an array of values.

Hashes will offer us the ability to access both key and value. We can return key
or value. But notice, again, that what is returned is an array.

```bash
[4] pry(main)> ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'].map do |fruit|
[4] pry(main)*   if fruit == 'banana'
[4] pry(main)*     fruit.capitalize
[4] pry(main)*   else
[4] pry(main)*     fruit
[4] pry(main)*   end
[4] pry(main)* end
=> ["apple", "orange", "Banana"]
[5] pry(main)> (1..20).collect{|num| num * 20}
=> [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320,
340, 360, 380, 400]
[6] pry(main)> hash = {"a" => 111, "b" => 222, "c" => 333}
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>333}
[7] pry(main)> hash.map{|k,v| k}
=> ["a", "b", "c"]
[8] pry(main)> hash.map{|k,v| v * 20}
=> [2220, 4440, 6660]
[9] pry(main)> hash.map{|k,v| "#{k}: #{v * 20}"}
=> ["a: 2220", "b: 4440", "c: 6660"]
[10] pry(main)> ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'].map {|fruit| puts
fruit.capitalize}
Apple
Orange
Banana
=> [nil, nil, nil]
```
