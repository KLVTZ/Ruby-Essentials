Comparison operator, or also known as the spaceship operator, will make a
comparison between two values. If the first value is less than the second, then
a negative number will be returned. If the value is equal then zero, else one if
it is greater than.

| Return | Definition |
| ------ | ---------- |
| -1     | Less than  |
|  0     | Equal	  |
|  1     | More than  |

If we use the sort method on an array, we can see that just calling sort will
result in a normally sorted array. Where scope comes into play is how we use the
comparison operator--whether that be in descending or ascending order.

If we call sort on an array of strings, the string will sort alphabetically. But
what if we wanted to compare them base on length? We could do the same
comparison operator again for a string lengths. If length is the only comparison
that matters, then we can compare the value by by just indicating that we want
to sort by one property method. For our instance, it's just the fruit string
length. As always, to apply a permanent change to array, just use bang.

We can do the same comparison with hashes. The only difference is that we have
to keep in mind that sort will convert our hash to an array. That is, an array
that contains an inner array for each index. Within that inner array, index one
will contain the key and index two, the value.

We make a comparison base on the array indexes. Whether that is comparing the
keys or the values, doesn't matter. What is returned is an array.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> 2 <=> 2
=> 0
[2] pry(main)> array = [3,1,5,2,4]
=> [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
[3] pry(main)> array.sort{|v1, v2| v1 <=> v2}                                                             
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[4] pry(main)> array.sort
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[5] pry(main)> array.sort.reverse
=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
[6] pry(main)> fruit = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
=> ["banana", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
[7] pry(main)> fruit.sort
=> ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"]
[8] pry(main)> fruit.sort{|f1, f2| f1.length <=> f2.length}
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]
[9] pry(main)> fruit.sort{|f1, f2| f2.length <=> f1.length}                                               
=> ["banana", "orange", "apple", "pear"]
[10] pry(main)> fruit.sort_by{|fruit| fruit.length}
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]
[11] pry(main)> fruit.sort_by{|fruit| fruit.reverse}                                                      
=> ["banana", "orange", "apple", "pear"]
[12] pry(main)> fruit.sort!{|fruit1, fruit2| fruit1.length <=> fruit2.length}                          
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]
[13] pry(main)> fruit
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]
[14] pry(main)> 
[14] pry(main)> hash = {"a" => 111, "b" => 222, "c" => 333}
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>333}
[15] pry(main)> hash.to_a
=> [["a", 111], ["b", 222], ["c", 333]]
[16] pry(main)> hash.sort{|item1, item2| item1[0] <=> item2[0]}
=> [["a", 111], ["b", 222], ["c", 333]]
[17] pry(main)> hash.sort{|item1, item2| item1[1] <=> item2[1]}
=> [["a", 111], ["b", 222], ["c", 333]]
[18] pry(main)> hash
