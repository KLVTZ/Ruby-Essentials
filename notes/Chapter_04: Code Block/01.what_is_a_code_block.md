What is a Code Block
====================
> Methods that use block include find, merge, collect, sort, and inject.

Code Block is a block scope or what access to variables in memory within a
predefined scope or range in memory. Conditionals and methods create their own
scope. Thus blocks are created in which have access to global variables and
posses their own code block variables. Code block variables are not reachable
from the global scope. This is because globals cannot access code blocks.
This is a basic programming paradigm.

In this example, we will go over each element, in the array, and multiply it by
twenty. Notice that the global scope has no access to the local scope that
creates the number variable. However, we can access global variables from local
scopes. 

Always be descriptive in your method names and variables. It will avoid
confusion.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> array = (1..5).to_a
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[2] pry(main)> array.each { |num| puts num * 20 }
20
40
60
80
100
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[3] pry(main)> puts num
NameError: undefined local variable or method `num' for main:Object
from (pry):3:in `__pry__'
[4] pry(main)> x = 2
=> 2
[5] pry(main)> x = 1
=> 1
[6] pry(main)> array.each { |num| puts num * 20 + x }
21
41
61
81
101
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
