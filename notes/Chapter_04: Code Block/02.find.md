Find
====
> Find methods help us find objects in data sets

- **find/detect**: returns an Obj. or nil
- **find_all/select**: returns Array
- **any?**: returns Boolean
- **All?**: returns Boolean
- **delete_if**: returns Array

Each requires a code block. It could even return a boolean expression.

Find / detect
-------------
The find method will return the first object that meets a condition. That is, in
our first example, we go through a range and find an increment value that equals
to five. Obviously, this is five. So find will return the first instance it
finds that proves true.

We can do the same with detect. We detect the increment that can be modulo by 3
with no remainder. Meaning it's dividable by three. The first instance that
detect finds would obviously be three.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> (1..10).find {|i| i == 5}
=> 5
[2] pry(main)> (1..10).find {|i| i % 3}
=> 1
[3] pry(main)> (1..10).find {|i| i % 3 == 0}
=> 3
[4] pry(main)> (1..10).find {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 3)}
=> 1
[5] pry(main)> (1..10).find {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 20)}
=> nil
[6] pry(main)> 
```

Any? / All?
-----------
To return a boolean value if such a range or array contains a number, we  should
use either any or all method. This will return a boolean expression that
expresses whether our conditional expression finds a match or not. The `any` method
will find if any of the value mathches whereas `all` must be true for all
increments.

```bash
[7] pry(main)> (1..10).any? {|i| i % 3 == 0}                                                                                                                                                                        
=> true
[8] pry(main)> (1..10).all? {|i| i % 3 == 0}
=> false
[9] pry(main)> (1..10).all? {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 3)}
=> false
```

Delete if
---------
If we want to alter a range and return an array of values that only deletes a
match, then we use this method. In this example, we delete any numbers that are
dividable by three.

```bash
[10] pry(main)> [*1..10]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[11] pry(main)> [*1..10].delete_if {|i| i % 3 == 0 }                                                                                                                                                                
=> [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10]
[12] pry(main)> 
```
