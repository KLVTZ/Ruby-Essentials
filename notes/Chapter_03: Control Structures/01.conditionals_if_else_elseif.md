Conditionals: if, else, elseif
==============================
> Control Structures provide the action ruby programming

```ruby
if boolean
	...
end
```

```ruby
if boolean
	...
	else
		...
end
```

```ruby
if boolean
	...
	elseif
		...
	else
		...
end
```

Ruby knows that when you proceed right after a condition statement, then you
will be in that if-else block. Therefore, there is no need for semicolons nor
braces to express scope.

We can check conditionals as usual and output results base on a condition --like
any other language. However, one cool thing to notice is that you can put the
condition after the defined statement. That is, you can define what you want to
happen and the conditional that must be met after the statement but before it
can be executed.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> name = "Justin"
=> "Justin"
[2] pry(main)> if name == "Bob"
[2] pry(main)*   puts "Found Bob!"
[2] pry(main)* else  
[2] pry(main)*   puts "Not Bob.."
[2] pry(main)* end  
Not Bob..
=> nil
[4] pry(main)> if name == "Justin"                                                                        
[4] pry(main)*   puts "Found Justin"  
[4] pry(main)* else  
[4] pry(main)*   puts "Not Justin"  
[4] pry(main)* end  
Found Justin
=> nil
[5] pry(main)> puts "This is Justin" if name == "Justin"
This is Justin
=> nil
[6] pry(main)> puts "This is Justin" if name == "bob"
=> nil
```
