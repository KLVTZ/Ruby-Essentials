Loops
=====
> Loop through a set of code based on a certain amount of iterations that are
> subjected on a condition

- **Break** = Terminate the whole loop,  basically you'll lose a conditional to
  break out of a loop
- **next** = Immediately jump out of the next loop or iteration
- **redo** = redo the same loop and same iteration
- **retry** = start over on the loop and retry

```ruby
while boolean
	...
end

until boolean
	...
end
```

While something is true, then do this. Until something is true, or while
something is false, then do the block.

```ruby
x = 0
puts x+=2 while x < 100

y = 3245
puts y/=2 until y <= 1
```

To go a step further, we could include a while or until statement at the end of
a block. Initially simplifying the loop into a single line. The first example
will increment the value of x by two and assign the incremented value while the
variable `x` does not reach 100. The second statement will divide, by whole
integer (floor method), until the variable `y` reaches an equivalent number of `1`
or less than.

```bash
[2] pry(main)> loop do
[2] pry(main)*   x += 2
[2] pry(main)*   break if x >= 20
[2] pry(main)*   next if x == 6
[2] pry(main)*   puts x
[2] pry(main)* end

=> nil
[3] pry(main)> x = 0
=> 0
[4] pry(main)> while x < 20 
[4] pry(main)*   x += 2
[4] pry(main)*   puts x
[4] pry(main)* end
