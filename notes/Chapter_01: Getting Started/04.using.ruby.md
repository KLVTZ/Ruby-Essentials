Using Ruby
==========
1. Single Command
2. Ruby File
3. PRY --an interactive ruby shell

To **run a single command** in ruby:
```bash
ruby -e <command>
```

To **run a file** in ruby:
```bash
ruby <name_of_file>
```

To run **PRY**:
```bash
pry
```

Our very first ruby file will demonstrate two example commands

- `puts`: outputs a string or integer with new line breaks before and after a
  clean output
- `print`: will output the same result but will not output any line breaks in
  terminal
