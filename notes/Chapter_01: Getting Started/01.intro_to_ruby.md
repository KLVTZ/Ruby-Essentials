Introduction to Ruby
====================

[<< Introduction](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_01:%20Getting%20Started/00.introduction.md)

What is Ruby?

- Programming Language
- Created in Japan in 1995 by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
- Syntax like Perl, Python, and Smalltalk
- Not a compiled language. A language that you write a code that then runs
  through a compiler
- Ruby is an interpreted language, therefore requires a Ruby interpreter.

Why Ruby?

- Object-Oriented
- Easily readable code (like English)
- Unsurprising syntax, naming, and behavior
- whitespace independent
- No semicolons
- Lots of "syntactic sugar" --it does nice things for you, a shortcut. Syntactic
  vinegar is the opposite

Ruby vs. Rails:

- Rails is a web framework that helps you build websites
- Ruby is not just for the web
