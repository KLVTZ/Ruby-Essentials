Installing Ruby
===============

[<< Intro to Ruby](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_01:%20Getting%20Started/01.intro_to_ruby.md)

- Make sure you install Ruby with the latest version. In this series, I will be
  working with Ruby 1.9
- Vim will be our editor of choice.
- Zsh will be our command line of choice.

to see that Ruby is installed, open up your terminal and type: `ruby -v`. You
should see a version number return.
