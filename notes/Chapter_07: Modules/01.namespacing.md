Namespacing
===========
> Wrappers around Ruby code

Modules work in a similar way to classes, but there is one big difference. They
cannot be instantiated. Furthermore, modules are used in conjuction with
classes. 

> Namespacing allows for class names that don't conflict

```ruby
module Romantic
	class Date
		...
	end
end

dinner = Romantic::Date.new
dinner.date = Date.new
```

Namespacing can:
- Keep class names distinct from standard Ruby classes
- Disambiguate your own class definitions
- Ensure classes used in open-sourced code won't conflict
