Mixins
======
- Ruby only allows classes to inherit from one superclass
- If additional functionality is needed, it can be placed into a module and
  mixed in. 

Mixins allow us to add the same functionality found in one class onto another
from possibly multiple different sources. Essentially offering multi-level
functionality.

In this lesson, we created a module that provides attribure accessors of
different properties. We also provide two different methods that includes the
full name and one in which returns the city, state, and zip code.

To include that mixin within a new class, we call the command `include` on our
available classes. Person will then recieve the included information as well as
Teacher. However, Student class will only inherit the properties because it's
parent is including the mixin

```ruby
module ContactInfo
	attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :city, :state, :zip_code

	def full_name
		return @first_name + " " + @last_name
	end

	def city_state_zip
		csz = @city
		csz += ", #{@state}" if @state
		csz += " #{@zip_code}" if @zip_code
		return csz
	end
end

class Person
	include ContactInfo
end

class Teacher
	include ContactInfo
	attr_accessor :lesson_plans
end

class Student < Person
	attr_accessor :books, :grades
end
```
