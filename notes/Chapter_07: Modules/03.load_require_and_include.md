Load, Require, and Include
==========================

[<< Mixins](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_07:%20Modules/02.mixins.md)

- Modules are usually kept in separate files
- Modules files can serve as code libraries
- Need to have a way to load modules into Ruby

Load
----
Loads a source file every time it is called. This leads to the dilemma of
repetition. We may load files multiple times when all we want is one time.
The more preferred way is require.

Require
-------
Loads a source file only once. This means that we don't have to load the file
over and over again. In fact, after loading it once, we are returned `true`.
Indicating that the file was loaded. However, upon another require of the same
file into memory, it returns `false`.

Require_Relative
----------------
Allows you to load a file that is relative to the file containing the
`require_relative` statement. This means not having to define a folder path
completely within your path statement

Include
--------
Includes modules, *nothing* to do with files. Unlike other languages, like PHP,
you do not use this command to include files, instead, they provide a means to
includes modules for non-obtrusive classes as well as mixins.

*contact_info.rb*
```ruby
module ContactInfo
	attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :city, :state, :zip_code

	def full_name
		return @first_name + " " + @last_name
	end

	def city_state_zip
		csz = @city
		csz += ", #{@state}" if @state
		csz += " #{@zip_code}" if @zip_code
		return csz
	end
end
```

```ruby
require_relative 'contact_info'

class Person
	include ContactInfo # brings in modules
end

class Teacher
	include ContactInfo
	attr_accessor :lesson_plans
end

class Student < Person
	attr_accessor :books, :grades
end
```
