Arrays
======
> An array is an ordered, interger-indexed collection of objects
 
- Objkects that can go in an array include strings, numbers, other arrays, and
  mixed types.
- All arrays are index zero.

Most attributes of an array are the same like any other language except for a
few differences.

To append or push a new value onto the array stack, we use two less than signs.
That is:

```bash
[1] pry(main)> data_set = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
[2] pry(main)> data_set << "e"
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
```

To clear an array, we can set the reference of the data set to an empty array or
we can call the clear method since that is a main method of the object Array

```bash
[3] pry(main)> data_set.clear
=> []
```
