>Floating point numbers.

Outside of programming, you will know this as decimal or numbers with precision. 

If we were to check the class of a float, we will see that is is part of class
`Float`. Furthermore, whenever a floating point precision is used, whether that
would be in an division problem, that float will be respected. We can round a
float through the round method. We can also convert a float to an integer by
calling the `to_i` method. Both method calls will round the numbers to the floor
value. We can even call floor as well as the ceiling method for specific rounding
methods.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> 1234.6789.class
=> Float
[2] pry(main)> x = 10
=> 10
[3] pry(main)> y = 10.0
=> 10.0
[4] pry(main)> y.class
=> Float
[5] pry(main)> x.class
=> Fixnum
[6] pry(main)> x + 1
=> 11
[7] pry(main)> y + 1
=> 11.0
[8] pry(main)> 10 / 3
=> 3
[9] pry(main)> 10.0 / 3
=> 3.3333333333333335
[10] pry(main)> 12345.7.round
=> 12346
[11] pry(main)> 12345.7.to_i
=> 12345
[12] pry(main)> 12345.7.floor
=> 12345
[13] pry(main)> 12345.7.ceil
=> 12346
[14] pry(main)> 
```
