Ranges
======

[<< Booleans](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_02:%20Ruby%20Object%20Types/10.booleans.md)

In this lesson, we take a look at ranges. Ranges are objects that contain a
range of numbers or letters. We have the possibility of depicting an inclusive
set of numbers or exclusive. The difference between the two lies in that
exclusive does not consider the last number or letter. If you want similar
behavior with inclusive ranges, then just define the exact range you want.

Inclusive Range: 1..10
---------------
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10`

Exclusive Range: 1...10
---------------
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9`

We can create a range or assign it to a variable. We have access to methods,
such as `begin`, `end`, `first`, and `last`. In addition, we have the ability to
check if a value is included in a range. Notice that ten is not included in the
range as it was exclusively defined with three dots.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> y = 1...10
=> 1...10
[2] pry(main)> y.last
=> 10
[3] pry(main)> y.begin
=> 1
[4] pry(main)> y.end
=> 10
[5] pry(main)> x = 1..10
=> 1..10
[6] pry(main)> x.include?(1)
=> true
[7] pry(main)> x.include?(10)
=> true
[8] pry(main)> y.include?(10)
=> false
```
To expand a range to an array, we can use the splat operator. This puts an
asterisk in front of the variable that contains the range. In turn, this will
output an array of string value containing the range. We can also implode a
range of letters in the same fashion.

```bash
[9] pry(main)> [*x]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[10] pry(main)> [*y]                                                                                      
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[11] pry(main)> z = [*x]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[12] pry(main)> 'a'..'m'
=> "a".."m"
[13] pry(main)> alpha = 'a'..'m'
=> "a".."m"
[14] pry(main)> alpha.include?('g')
=> true
[15] pry(main)> alpha = [*alpha]
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m"]
[16] pry(main)> alpha
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m"]
[17] pry(main)> alpha.to_a
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m"]
```
