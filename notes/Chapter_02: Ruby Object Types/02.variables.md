Variables
=========
[<< Objects](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_02:%20Ruby%20Object%20Types/01.objects.md)

Variables are not objects. A rare exception to the rule.

- Variables allow us to easily reference objects in Ruby
- Variables will be defined or act like an object

Notice how we can assign variables simply through assigning a reference to a
variable. We can pass through a numerical value, pass through a reference of
another object, and still reference the value again. Ruby will copy a reference
of a value to another object. It does not move a pointer in reference to a space
in memory to another object reference.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> a = 100
=> 100
[2] pry(main)> b = a
=> 100
[3] pry(main)> b
=> 100
[4] pry(main)> a = 50
=> 50
[5] pry(main)> b
=> 100
[6] pry(main)>
```

Scope indicators
-----------------
- **Global**: `$variable`
- **Class**: `@@variable`
- **Instance**: `@variable`
- **Local**: `variable`
- **Block**: `variable`
