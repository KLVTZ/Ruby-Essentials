Booleans
========
> A boolean is true or false. A discrete, binary, property.

As far as regards to logical comparisons, ruby treats discrete logic like any
other programming language. However, keep in mind that the true and false that
may be returned are objects in themselves. The true object belongs to the `True
Class` and false object belongs to the `False Class`.

Many times when we check to see if an object is contained within a list or any
sort of method that may return a boolean: we use a question mark. Therefore, the
following examples all have a question mark appended to the end of each method
call. Whether that is checking to see if a value is between a list, if it's
empty, or if it included in a value. Each returns a proper boolean.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> x = 1
=> 1
[2] pry(main)> x.nil?
=> false
[3] pry(main)> y = nil
=> nil
[4] pry(main)> y.nil?
=> true
[5] pry(main)> 2.between?(1,4)
=> true
[6] pry(main)> 2.between?(3,4)
=> false
[7] pry(main)> [1,2,3].empty?
=> false
[8] pry(main)> [].empty?
=> true
[9] pry(main)> [1,2,3].include?(4)
=> false
[10] pry(main)>
```
