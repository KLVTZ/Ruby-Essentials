Integers
========
Integers are numbers. But ruby divides numbers into two separate categories:

1. Integer
2. Float (Floating point numbers)

To cover integers in more detail. We can treat Ruby calculations in a very
similar fashion to other languages. A few differences arise in how we handle
exponents:

```ruby
2 ** 2 = 4 # A little bit different but this is how we handle exponents
```

Remember integers are objects. Therefore, if we check the class of the object,
we will see that a number may return a Fix Number or a Big Number.

```ruby
1234.class # will return a fix number
```

Other method we can call include absolute value:

```ruby
-200.abs # will equal 200
```

To increment to the next value, we can call: `200.next`
