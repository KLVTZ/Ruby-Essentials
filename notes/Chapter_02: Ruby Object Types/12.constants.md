Constants
=========

[<< Ranges](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_02:%20Ruby%20Object%20Types/11.ranges.md)

Constants are similar to variables:
- Not true objects
- Points to objects

Constants are different in that they remain constant

- If you use constants, you can use capital letters or a first letter uppercase
  word. That is any variable beginning with an uppercase letter is considered a
  constant

- Once you set a constant, you should not change the value. Notice I said
  *should* and not that you *coulnd't*.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> test = 1
=> 1
[2] pry(main)> TEST = 2
=> 2
[3] pry(main)> Hello = 10
=> 10
[4] pry(main)> test = 100
=> 100
[5] pry(main)> TEST = 100
(pry):5: warning: already initialized constant TEST
(pry):2: warning: previous definition of TEST was here
=> 100
[6] pry(main)> TEST
=> 100
[7] pry(main)> Hello = 20
(pry):7: warning: already initialized constant Hello
(pry):3: warning: previous definition of Hello was here
=> 20
```
