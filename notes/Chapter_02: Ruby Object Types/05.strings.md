Strings
=======
> Strings are sequences of characters that are strung together.

- We can use single or double quotes.
  - Remember, character escapes are rendered in double quotes.
- We can multiply strings.
  - Their object-like property will be repeated by the number of times it is
	asked to be multiplied.
- Like other languages, we can concatenate strings together.
- We can reverse, capitalize, uppper-case, down-case, and get the
  length of strings. 
  - We can chain methods on each object because an object will be returned by
	each object
- We can insert values inside a string through the use of hashes and brackets

```bash
[1] pry(main)> print "Hello\n\nGoodbye"
Hello

Goodbye=> nil
[2] pry(main)> puts "Hello" * 5
HelloHelloHelloHelloHello
=> nil
[3] pry(main)> puts "Hello " * 5                                                                          
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello 
=> nil
[4] pry(main)> puts "Hello" + " Goodbye"
Hello Goodbye
=> nil
[5] pry(main)> "Hello".reverse
=> "olleH"
[6] pry(main)> "Hello".upcase
=> "HELLO"
[7] pry(main)> "Hello".downcase
=> "hello"
[8] pry(main)> "Hello".length
=> 5
[9] pry(main)> "hello".capitalize
=> "Hello"
[10] pry(main)> 
```

```bash
[1] pry(main)> greeting = "Hello"
=> "Hello"
[2] pry(main)> target = "world"
=> "world"
[3] pry(main)> puts "I want to say #{greeting} #{target}"
I want to say Hello world
=> nil
[4] pry(main)> puts "1 + 1 = #{1 + 1}"
1 + 1 = 2
