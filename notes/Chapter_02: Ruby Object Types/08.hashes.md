Hashes

[<< Array Methods](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_02:%20Ruby%20Object%20Types/07.array_methods.md)

> Hashes are similar to arrays.

A hash is an unordered, object-index collection of objects (think of them as
key-value pairs). Hashes are not in any sort of order --each index will have a
name or key.

When order matters use an array. Where labels or keys matter, use
hashes.

Hashes are associative arrays. Similar to JavaScript objects, in order to make a
Hash collection, we need to use braces. Our keys can be `strings`, `integers,` or
even `arrays`. To reference a value within the collection, we call the value by
the key name. We also do so by using brackets. Each key pointing to a value in a
way that is similar to PHP.

As always, with hash collections, you have access to a few methods such as
`size`, `length`, `to_array`, and `clear`. In addition, you have access to keys.
Please keep in mind that a hash is a non-ordered collection that is organized by
key-value pairs.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> mixed = {1 => ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'hello' => 'world', [10,20] =>
'top'}
=> {1=>["a", "b", "c"], "hello"=>"world", [10, 20]=>"top"}
[2] pry(main)> mixed[1]
=> ["a", "b", "c"]
[3] pry(main)> mixed['hello']
=> "world"
[4] pry(main)> mixed[[10,20]]
=> "top"
[5] pry(main)> mixed.keys
=> [1, "hello", [10, 20]]
[6] pry(main)> mixed.values
=> [["a", "b", "c"], "world", "top"]
```
