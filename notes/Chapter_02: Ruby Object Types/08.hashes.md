Hashes
======
> Hashes are similar to arrays.

A hash is an unordered, object-index collection of objects (think of them as
key-value pairs). Hashes are not in any sort of order --each index will have a
name or key.

When order matters use an array. Where care more about the label or key, use
hashes.

Hashes are associative arrays. Similar to JavaScript objects, in order to make a
Hash collection, we need to use braces. Our keys can be `strings`, `integers,` or
even `arrays`. To reference a value within the collection, we call the value by
the key name. We also do so by using brackets. Each key pointing to a value in a
way that is similar to PHP.

As always, with hash collections, you have access to a few methods such as
`size`, `length`, `to_array`, and `clear`. In addition, you have access to keys.
Please keep in mind that a hash is a non-ordered collection that is organized by
key-value pairs.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> mixed = {1 => ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'hello' => 'world', [10,20] =>
'top'}
=> {1=>["a", "b", "c"], "hello"=>"world", [10, 20]=>"top"}
[2] pry(main)> mixed[1]
=> ["a", "b", "c"]
[3] pry(main)> mixed['hello']
=> "world"
[4] pry(main)> mixed[[10,20]]
=> "top"
[5] pry(main)> mixed.keys
=> [1, "hello", [10, 20]]
[6] pry(main)> mixed.values
=> [["a", "b", "c"], "world", "top"]
```
