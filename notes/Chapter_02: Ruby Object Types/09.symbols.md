Symbols
=======
Symbol is a label to identify a piece of data. A symbol is only stored in memory
one time. If you need to process a hash collection and need the keys as output,
then use strings else use symbols. The reason behind this, is that your primary
concern is only the value. If so, there is no point in making additional memory
in reference for something you'll never use. This is not to say you cannot
reference a hash collection uses symbols. Instead, symbols provide an easy way
to grab information from a hash collection without taking up considerable amount
of memory.

In this example, notice that we reference the key as a symbol in order to return
the value. We have no access to the key as it's own string name but we do have
access to the value.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> :test
=> :test
[2] pry(main)> "test".object_id
=> 70127602613340
[3] pry(main)> :test.object_id
=> 197768
[4] pry(main)> "test".object_id
=> 70127600657720
[5] pry(main)> :test.object_id                                                                                                                                                                                       
=> 197768
[6] pry(main)> :another_test
=> :another_test
[7] pry(main)> :another_test.object_id
=> 781928
[8] pry(main)> :test.object_id
=> 197768
[9] pry(main)> hash = {:first => 'Justin', :last_name => 'Page'}                                                                                                                                               
=> {:first=>"Justin", :last_name=>"Page"}
[10] pry(main)> hash = {:first_name => 'Justin', :last_name => 'Page'}
=> {:first_name=>"Justin", :last_name=>"Page"}
[11] pry(main)> hash['first_name']
=> nil
[12] pry(main)> hash[:first_name]
=> "Justin"
```
