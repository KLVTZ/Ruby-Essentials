Objects
=======

[Chapter 1: Getting Started | Documentation](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_02:%20Ruby%20Object%20Types/01.objects.md)

Ruby is an object oriented programming language.

- Everything in Ruby are Objects. All Object types are objects
- An object is the fundamental building block in ruby

An object example is a classroom. We would have students in the classroom who
would be objects as well. The classroom can have many desks and students. We
can use objects to explain complex types. We can have an object as an abstracted
type, such as the communication between students.

- Objects are instances of a class
- Each student is an object or instance of a student
- They are unique in reference but share common property definitions
