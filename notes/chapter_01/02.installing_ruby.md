Installing Ruby
===============

- Make sure you install Ruby with the latest version. In this series, I will be
  working with Ruby 1.9
- Vim will be our editor of choice.
- Zsh will be our command line of choice.

to see that Ruby is installed, open up your terminal and type: `ruby -v`. You
should see a version number return.
