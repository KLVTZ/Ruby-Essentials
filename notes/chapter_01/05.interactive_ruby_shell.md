Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB)
===========================
IRB is a command line interface for ruby.

- We can interact with code in real-time
- Works like a calculator
- Great for testing code and tinkering

Some things you can do in PRY, or IRB, includes math calculations and outputting
results to your command line. Notice that when you call puts, it outputs the
result that you expect, but it also returns `nil`. Nil means a score of zero
--it's ruby version of null. However, unlike other object-oriented languages,
`nil` is an object in itself. I might add that the calculations in Ruby are
extremely fast!
