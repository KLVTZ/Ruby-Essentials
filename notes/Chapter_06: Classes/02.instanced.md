Instances
=========
[<< Defining and using classes](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/01.defining_and_using_classes.md)
> A case or an occurrence, an example put forth. An object created from a class.

We can think of instances the same way we look at post-it notes with predefined
boxes. Each are an instance of the original, but put forth with effort, they are
different by their properties. 

More specifically, Instances register themselves into a unique space that is not
shared by another. 

To create an instance, we call the object's `new` method. This will create a new
occurrence of the object or instance. We can then call the `make_noise` property
as usual. 

Keep in mind that we will be using object variables or properties to
differentiate one object's instance from another.

```ruby
class Animal
	def make_noise
		"Moo!"
	end
end

animal1 = Animal.new
puts animal1.make_noise

animal2 = Animal.new
puts animal2.make_noise
```
