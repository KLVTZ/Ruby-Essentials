Reader-Writer Methods
=====================

[<< Attributes](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/03.attributes.md)

Reader and Writer methods or Getters and Setters methods are methods that are
responsible for setting and getting attribute values. More specifically, they
are methods who assign a value to our defined attribute and can also be
responsible for returning that set value whenever it is requested.

Drawing back from our previous lesson, we could create a set and get method of
noise. However, Ruby offers syntactic sugar for reading and writing. To assign
an attribute, we define the method with an equal sign. To get the value, we just
define a method that will return the value. In many ways, this is a quick way
for Ruby to set and get an attribute. However, is there a shorter way? Yes, we
cover this in the next lesson.

```ruby
class Animal
	def noise=(noise)
		@noise = noise
	end

	def noise
		@noise
	end
end

animal1 = Aninoise=mal.new
animal1.noise = "Moo"
puts animal1.noise

animal2 = Animal.new
animal2.noise = "Quack"
puts animal2.noise
```
