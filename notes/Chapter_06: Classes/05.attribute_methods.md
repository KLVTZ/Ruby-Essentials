Attribute Methods
=================

[<< Reader-writer methods](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/04.reader-writer_methods.md)

> `attr_*` methods

- `attr_reader`: make an attribute readable but not writable by default
- `attr_writer`: make an attribute writable but not readable by default
- `attr_accessor`: make an attribute readable and writable.

Attribute accessors methods are just shorthand methods that allow you to
write, access, or both in one command. In this example, we allow the `name`
attribute to be accessed by both reader and writer methods that ruby generates.
Whereas color can only be written to but cannot be read by default. `legs` and
`arms` can only be read but not written to by default. Why the addition of by
default? Because you can most certainly write your own custom methods to provide
the same access as the name attribute --you just have to provide it. 

Overall, Ruby provides a time saving way to access attribute values. This is
an extremely handy when method for handling large sets of readers and writers.

```ruby
class Animal
	attr_accessor :name
	attr_writer :color
	attr_reader :legs, :arms

	def setup_limbs
		@legs = 4
		@arms = 0
	end

	def noise=(noise)
		@noise = noise
	end

	def noise
		@noise
	end

	def color
		"The color is #{@color}."
	end
end

animal1 = Animal.new
animal1.setup_limbs
animal1.noise = "Moo"
animal1.name = "Bob"
animal1.color = "black"

puts animal1.color
puts animal1.name
puts animal1.noise
puts animal1.legs
```
