Attributes
==========
> An attribute is a value that persists inside of an instance.

Instace `@variable` is what is needed to be used within the instance of the
class. These instances are not directly accessible from outside the scope of the
object. Instead, we need methods or properties that allow us to set and grab
attributes that are persisted inside that instance.

In this example, we created a `set_noise` method. This method will set the value
of an instance property. We will be using the `@variable` notation to define an
attribute. By doing this, we are able to set and make noises with two very
different properties.

```ruby
class Animal
	def set_noise(noise)
		@noise = noise
	end

	def make_noise
		@noise
	end
end

animal1 = Animal.new
animal1.set_noise("Moo")
puts animal1.make_noise

animal2 = Animal.new
animal2.set_noise("Quack")
puts animal2.make_noise
```
