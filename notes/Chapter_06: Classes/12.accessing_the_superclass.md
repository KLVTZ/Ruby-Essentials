Accessing the Superclass
========================

[<< Subclass Overriding](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/11.subclass_overriding.md)

The keyword `super` will allow us to access the super-class method. We can then
call the parent's method that we inherited from. But keep in mind that when we
do call this method, we are calling a method. Not returning that value directly. 

In this example, we create another sub-class of `Pig`. Pig will inherit from
`Animal`. We define a function of noise, essentially over-writing the original.
We call the original method through `super`. But, again, we still need to
process what is returned from the method.

```ruby
class Pig < Animal
	def noise
		super # just a method, doesn't return it as that value.
		"Hello and also #{super}"
	end
end

wilbur = Pig.new("Oink!")
puts wilbur.noise
```
