Initialize Method
=================

[<< Attribute Methods](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/05.attribute_methods.md)

Initialization allows us to pass on values to a initialize method that belongs
to a class. More specifically, whenever we initialize a value, we back
initialize it with already pre-defined values that we either assign or pass.

Within Ruby, we take advantage of the `initialize` method. We can define it
within a class. Like other methods, we can pass through arguments as well as
default values. 

In our example, we pass through three arguments. We assign the
attribute value noise, legs, and arms. We define a message to inform the user
that a new animal was instantiated. All in all, this follows any other initial
creation of a class in object-oriented programming.

```ruby
class Animal
	attr_accessor :name
	attr_writer :color
	attr_reader :legs, :arms

	def initialize(noise, legs = 4, arms = 0)
		@noise = noise
		@legs = 4
		@arms = 0
		puts "A new animal has been instantiated."
	end

	def noise=(noise)
		@noise = noise
	end

	def noise
		@noise
	end

	def color
		"The color is #{@color}."
	end
end

animal1 = Animal.new("Moo", 4, 0)
animal1.name = "Bob"
animal1.color = "black"

puts animal1.color
puts animal1.name
puts animal1.noise
puts animal1.legs

animal2 = Animal.new("Quack")
animal2.noise = "Quack"
puts animal2.noise
```
