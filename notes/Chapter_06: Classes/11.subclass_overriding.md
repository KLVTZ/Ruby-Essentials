Subclass Overriding
===================

[<< Inheritance](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/10.inheritance.md)

You love everything there is about inheritance. But there is that one method you
just don't want. More specifically, that one method isn't behaving according to
how your sub-class should react. Thankfully, we can override any inherited
method from within our subclass.

To do this we simple define the method name that follows in-line with the
parent. In this example, we overwrite the color method. We return a string and
the color value specific to that instance.

```ruby
maisie = Cow.create_with_attributes("Moo!", "yellow")
puts maisie.color
```

Thus our sub-class differentiates itself and overrides a parent method.

To think of this in a different light, let's take a look at how an
array-to-string conversion works. 

```bash
[1] pry(main)> x = [1, 2, 3]
=> [1, 2, 3]
[2] pry(main)> x.to_s
=> "[1, 2, 3]"
```

This is fine, but what if we want to overwrite the default behavior? Easy:

```bash
[3] pry(main)> class Array
[3] pry(main)*   def to_s
[3] pry(main)*     self.join(', ')
[3] pry(main)*   end  
[3] pry(main)* end  
=> :to_s
[4] pry(main)> x.to_s
=> "1, 2, 3"
```

By actually defining and over-writing a Ruby class, we provide a new definition
for an already existing method. Now are behavior will react as such. This
illustrates the power of sublcass overriding.
