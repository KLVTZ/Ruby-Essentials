Class Methods
=============

[<< Initialize methods](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_06:%20Classes/06.initialize_methods.md)

Class methods are methods which are available to be called without
instantiation. Think back to our `Animal.new` class method call. This will
return a new instance of our Animal class. We never had to instantiate the class
before calling that method, we had it available for us.

Taking this a step further, we can create our own class methods:
```ruby
def self.method_name
	...
end
```
The self is reference to the current class the word is encapsulated by. In this
example, self refers to Animal. Our first class method we create involves an
array of all species within our listing:

```ruby
	def self.all_species 
		['cat', 'cow', 'dog', 'duck', 'horse', 'pig']
	end
```

We can call this class method by `puts Animal.all_species.inspect` to output the
array in a human readable format.

Our second example is a little more practical. We return a new instance with
attributes. We require both noise and a color. Within this method, we create a
new instance, having to pass through noise as a required argument. We then
assign the color on that instance --taking advantage of the attribute writer.
Finally, we return the new instance for us to process globally.

```ruby
animal2 = Animal.create_with_attributes("Quack", "white")
puts animal2.noise
puts animal2.color
```
