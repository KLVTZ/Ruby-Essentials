Class Attributes
================
> Store values that apply to the class generally

We've seen instance methods, class methods, and now we will overview class
attributes. Class attributes are attributes that are readily available in every
class. To create a class attribute, we simple create an attribute with two `@`
symbols. This indicates that it is a class attribute.

We create two class attributes, one is for species and the other is a container
for current animals that we instantiate as a class. We can access our species
array through the attribute method to which references this class attribute.

```ruby
	@@species =	['cat', 'cow', 'dog', 'duck', 'horse', 'pig']
	@@current_animals = [];

	def self.all_species 
		@@species
	end
```

However, in our other example, we push the latest instance of the Animal object
onto the current animals array. This occurs every time our initialize method is
called. Whether that is through the class method `new` or
`create_with_attributes`. However, just referencing the class attribute alone is
not enough. Indeed, this is not possible by itself. Like instant atrributes, we
need accessor methods --getters and setters.

```ruby
	def initialize(noise, legs = 4, arms = 0)
		@noise = noise
		@legs = 4
		@arms = 0
		@@current_animals << self #instance ~ object it is inside at the moment 
		puts "A new animal has been instantiated."
	end

# trying to access the current animal's class attribute globally
puts Animal.all_species.inspect
```
