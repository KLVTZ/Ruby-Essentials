> Bestowal of methods and attributes of another class

In this lesson, we cover inhertance. At it's most basic level, inheritance is
the passing of methods and attributes from a super-class onto a sub-class. The
parent will pass on it's properties for all it's children to inherit.

In this example, we have a super-class of Animal. Animal already has an
initializer as well as other methods that define what an animal is. To pass this
properties and methods onto another sub-class, we use the following syntax:

```ruby
SubClass < ParentClass
	...
end
```

From here, the subclass will inherit all methods and attributes associated with
the parent. Remember, this includes any initializer requirements.

```ruby
class Cow < Animal

end

# we can call the available methods:
maisie = Cow.new("Moo!")
puts maisie.noise

puts animal1.class # returns Animal
puts maisie.class  # returns Cow
```
