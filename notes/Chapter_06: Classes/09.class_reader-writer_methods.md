Class reader-writer methods
===========================

Class readers and writers do not have attribute accessors. As such, we need to
define our getters and setters manually. To do this, we first create a setter.
Using syntactic sugar, we can define a self class attribute that expects and
array. We provide an empty array as fall-back. We then assign the class attribute
with the array that is passed through. As such, we have successfully assigned a
species array with two different animals

```ruby
	def self.species=(array=[])
		@@species = array
	end
```

When it comes to accessing the species, we can use the shorthand syntax of
defining a self method that returns the class attribute of species.

```ruby
	def self.species
		@@species
	end
```

We now have reader and writer access to the class attributes. Keep in mind that
Rails has included a class attribute accessors built-in the framework.
But not the core of Ruby itself.
