File Paths
==========
- Absolute path: `/path/to/file` or root path
- Relative path: `./../../path/to/file` or know where you are

If we  use `__FILE__` (FILE with two underscores on either side) File will
return the name. To find the full absolute path we can use
`File.expand_path(__FILE__)`.  To find the directory name, we can use
`File.dirname(__FILE__)`.

It's best to use relative directories as much as possible as it represents our
current working directory in relation to our file system. Absolute path requires
a more verbose path structure than what relative path implies.

If we look at our working example, we can consider a few scenarios that involve
both absolute and relative paths:

```ruby
# Absolute paths
# use forward slashes, even on windows
puts "/var/www/Ruby-Essentials/sandbox/chapter_08"

# File.join ensures platform dependencies
# absolute path is made by passing an empty string as first argument
puts File.join('', 'var', 'www', 'Ruby-Essentials', 'sandbox', 'chapter_08')

# Relative paths
# __FILE__ is THIS file
puts __FILE__

# expand_path will convert a relative path to an absolute path
# in this case, it returns the full path of the file
puts File.expand_path(__FILE__)

# relative paths are easiest when you start with
# this file's directory
puts File.dirname(__FILE__)

# .. "moves back" one directory
puts File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'chapter_08')
```
