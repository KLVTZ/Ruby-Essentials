Input-Output Basics
===================
> I/O = Input/Output

- print: outputs a string with no line return
- puts: outputs a string with a line return
- gets: waits for user input -- a single line ending return
- chomp: remove any line ending ("\n", "\r\n")
- chop: would remove ANY final character (chomp is preferred)

In the following example, we will demonstrate the use of gets. Gets waits for
user input and thus allows us to collect it as a value. If we accompany
the gets method with chomp, we will remove unneeded line endings.

```bash
>> gets
Hello.
=> "Hello.\n"
>> input = gets
Hello.
=> "Hello.\n"
>> input
=> "Hello.\n"
>> "This is a test of chomp.\n".chomp
=> "This is a test of chomp."
>> input = gets.chomp
This is input      
=> "This is input"
>> input
=> "This is input"
```

In our second example, we will demonstrate the simple example above in ruby
script. In addition, we will create a loop that constantly grab user input and
output it as a value. We can do this until we type "quit".

```ruby
input = gets.chomp

print "You just told me: "
puts input + "."

# use gets inside a loop for more user input
result = ""
until result == "quit"
	print "> "
	result = gets.chomp
	puts "I heard #{result}"
end
puts "Goodbye!"
```

So why are we focusing on input and output?  Files are just a type of input and
output. We are reading things from the file and then writing things to a file.
`IO` handles the input and ouput that surrounds the subclass of files. Thus we
can apply these IO basics to working with files in ruby.
