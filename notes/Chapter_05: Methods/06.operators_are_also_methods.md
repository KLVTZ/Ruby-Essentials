Operators are also methods
==========================
> Common operators in Ruby are methods too!

```ruby
pry(main)> 8 - 2
=> 6
[2] pry(main)> 8.-(2)
=> 6
[3] pry(main)> 8*2
=> 16
[4] pry(main)> 8.*(2)
=> 16
[5] pry(main)> 8./(2)
=> 4
[6] pry(main)> 8**2
=> 64
[7] pry(main)> 8.**(2)
=> 64
```

Syntastic sugar has made it easier to write common operators instead of actual
methods.

```ruby
[8] pry(main)> array = []
=> []
[9] pry(main)> array << 4
=> [4]
[10] pry(main)> array.<<(4)
=> [4, 4]
[11] pry(main)> array[1]
=> 4
[12] pry(main)> array.[](1)
=> 4
[13] pry(main)> array[2] = 'x'
=> "x"
[14] pry(main)> array.[]=(2, 'y')
=> "y"
[15] pry(main)> array
=> [4, 4, "y"]
```

The important part to take away from this is that we can write methods using
these symbols, they aren't reserved for Ruby.

That is why we call a string and then multiply method. Not the other way around.
That is because an integer doesn't have that string method call as it's own
object method.
