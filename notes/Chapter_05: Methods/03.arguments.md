Arguments
=========

[<< Variable scope in methods](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_05:%20Methods/02.variable_scope_in_methods.md)

- Arguments are a comma-separated list of values that are passed into methods
- Values are passed when they are called.

Unlike other programming languages, using the parenthesis as a parameter
argument container is optional. Typing the parameter argument, however, aids in
clarity. In this example, we demonstrated that we can pass through parameter
arguments to all our methods. What is contained within the parenthesis becomes
an instance variable that is passed through the methods to then be used.

```ruby
# Methods with arguments typically use parantheses
# Methods without arguments typically do not.
# Parantheses are optional in both cases.

def welcome(name)
	puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

def add(n1, n2)
	puts n1 + n2
end

# underscore between words, like variable names
def longest_word(words)
	longest_word = words.inject do |memo, word|
		memo.length > word.length ? memo : word
	end
	puts longest_word
end

# method names can have question marks in them
# useful for tests and booleans
def over_five?(value)
	puts value > 5 ? 'Over five' : 'Not over 5'
end

# must define methods before calling them
# definition first
welcome("Justin")
welcome("Bob")
welcome "Jeff"
add(2,2)
fruits  = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'plum']
longest_word(fruits)
over_five?(8)
over_five?(112 / 18)
```
