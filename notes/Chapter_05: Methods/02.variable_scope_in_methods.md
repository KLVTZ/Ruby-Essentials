Variable scope in methods
=========================
Variable scope in methods are a bit more complex than regular block scopes.
Local scopes are local to the scope of that method. Local scopes and their
instances work in a very similar fashion in comparison to object-oriented
languages. Anything within block scope methods will not be accessible globally.

Now there is a way to bypass a method so that it can access an instance variable
outset its scope. We use the `@` symbol to define an instance variable. An
instance variable is a variable that can be accessed within a method. However,
we want to use this sparingly. This assume that such a variable has an already
defined value. If not, a method relying on that variable will throw an
exception.

```ruby
@words = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'plum']

def longest_word
	longest_word = @words.inject do |memo, word|
		memo.length > word.length ? memo : word
	end
	puts longest_word
end
```
