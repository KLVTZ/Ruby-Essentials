Return Values
=============

[<< Argument default values](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_05:%20Methods/04.arguments_default_values.md)

- Methods have a default return value: the last operation's return value
- Return will both return a value and exit the method
- Returning a value and using puts outside a method can provide more flexibility
  than using puts inside
- Return is especially useful with conditional statements
- Methods can return only one object, use an array to return more

In this example, we demonstrated in our first method how we can return a value
but the statement after is not executed. That is because it will return a value
and exit the method. We can also return multiple objects. To do so, we use an
array to contain both object values we would like to return. In a way, it houses
multiple values.

Many times within our methods, we may have multiple return statements. Doing so,
should be based primarily on a condition on what value to return.

Last note to consider is that when we return multiple values, we can process
them through an each loop or we can map them to two values.

```ruby
def welcome(name = "World")
	return "Hello, #{name}!"
	2 + 2
end

def add_and_subtract(n1, n2=0)
	add = n1 + n2
	sub = n1 - n2
	return add, sub
end

def longest_word(words=[])
	longest_word = words.inject do |memo, word|
		memo.length > word.length ? memo : word
	end
	return longest_word
end

def over_five?(value=nil)
	return "Exactly 5" if value.to_i == 5
	if value.to_i > 5
		return "Over 5"
	end
	return "Under 5"
end

puts welcome("Justin")
returned_value = welcome("John")
puts returned_value
welcome
result = add_and_subtract(2,2)
result.each {|x| puts x}
add, sub = add_and_subtract(8, 3) # catching both and assigning
```
