Defining and calling methods
============================

[Chapter 4: Code Block | Inject](https://github.com/KLVTZ/Ruby-Essentials/blob/master/notes/Chapter_04:%20Code%20Block/05.sort.md)

We have been working with methods this entire time:

```ruby
"hello".reverse.capitalize
1.upto(5){...}
[1,5,4,3,2].sort{...}
```

These are object methods. We will de dealing with standalone methods, or
functions.

```ruby
def some_name
	...
end
```

To define a method, we define a method name. Anything between the method block
will be waiting for our call.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> def welcome
[1] pry(main)*   puts "hello, world"
[1] pry(main)* end
=> :welcome
[2] pry(main)> :welcome
=> :welcome
[3] pry(main)> welcome
hello, world
=> nil
```

In order to work more closely with Ruby, we will start using files as a means to
contain our code. This makes sense as our applications will grow and become more
complex.

We went ahead and created a file that contains three methods. These three
methods include defining a welcome method, longest word method, and a boolean
checker to see if something is over five. Notice that all three methods are
implementations from an earlier section.

```ruby
def welcome
	puts "Hello, World"
end

def add
	puts 1 + 1
end

# underscore between words, like variable names
def longest_word
	words = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'plum']
	longest_word = words.inject do |memo, word|
		memo.length > word.length ? memo : word
	end
	puts longest_word
end

# method names can have question marks in them
# useful for tests and booleans
def over_five?
	value = 3
	puts value > 5 ? 'Over five' : 'Not over 5'
end

# must define methods before calling them
# definition first
welcome
add
longest_word
over_five?
```

In order to launch our methods, we must call them by name. Not using any dot
notation as that is reserved for object properties.

To use our named file, all we need to do is call: `ruby methods.rb` and it will
run all our function calls as normal.

If we don't want to call all methods within our file, we can call them in the
interactive shell. Specifically, we need to access all methods before calling
them. To do this, we require a relative path to the file. This usually assumes
current directory.

```bash
[1] pry(main)> require_relative "methods"
Hello, World
2
banana
Not over 5
=> true
[2] pry(main)> welcome
Hello, World
=> nil
[3] pry(main)> add
2
=> nil
```
